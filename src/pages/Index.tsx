            <p>
              Two paths diverged in a world remade,<br />
              And sorry I could not travel both<br />
              And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
              And looked down one as far as I could<br />
              To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            </p>
            <p>
              Two paths diverged in a world remade,<br />
              One forged by science, bright and clear,<br />
              The other cloaked in faith's charade,<br />
              Where progress bent beneath the blade,<br />
              And knowledge drowned in fear.
            </p>
            <p>
              They chose the shadowed trail instead,<br />
              Where reason's light could never thrive.<br />
              Books were burned, and minds were led<br />
              By ancient laws the zealots fed,<br />
              To keep the lie alive.
            </p>
            <p>
              The labs fell silent, their doors locked tight,<br />
              The cure for pain a banned refrain.<br />
              No sterile tools, no healing light,<br />
              No saving hands to mend the nightâ€”<br />
              Just suffering ordained.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet still, some spark refused to fade,<br />
              A secret whispered, deep and slow:<br />
              The truth that science once conveyed<br />
              Could not be killed, nor fully stayed,<br />
              Its roots begin to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so, beneath the crimson tide,<br />
              The seeds of reason find their ground.<br />
              Though darkness claims the world outside,<br />
              Through hidden acts, and quiet pride,<br />
              The path unseen is found.
