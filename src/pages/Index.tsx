              Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
              And sorry I could not travel both<br />
              And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
              And looked down one as far as I could<br />
              To where it bent in the undergrowth;
            </p>
            <p>
              Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
              And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
              Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
              Though as for that the passing there<br />
              Had worn them really about the same,
            </p>
            <p>
              And both that morning equally lay<br />
              In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
              Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
              Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
              I doubted if I should ever come back.
            </p>
            <p>
              I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
              Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
              Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br />
              I took the one less traveled by,<br />
              And that has made all the difference.
